Hi! This is supposed to be an AI program that will take your submission and generate a response.
I'm not too sure on if it works, as it will not allow me to generate anything else without giving them money, so pray that this works.

HERE IS HOW TO USE YOUR OWN API KEY!!!!!!!!!
create a file named .env
format it like this
OPENAI_API_KEY ="insert api key here"

If it doesn't work, I'm sorry. I literally can't get it to generate anything anymore. I was trying to get it to actually generate text, and when it finally stopped giving me code errors, it told me that I met my quota and that I needed to refer to their billing/plans, so thats great, I'm not making another openai account, sorry.
